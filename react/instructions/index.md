# Premier League

## React Coding Challenge

### Overview
The Premier League development team have been tasked to create a Fixture Predictor game. The Business Analysts have been in touch with the stakeholder and created two user stories to match their requirements. They have provided two wireframes as a guide to fulfil the request.

Please follow the instructions below to complete the task.

When complete, please delete `node_modules` & zip the folder up and return to Premier League prior to the next recruitment stage.

### Setup
- The project has been scaffolded with vite, our React local development tooling.
- run `npm install` to add local dependencies.
- To start the local server, run `npm run dev`
- Ensure you also run the local [API Service](./api.md)
- Additional libraries, such as `styled-components`, can be installed if desired.
- All data must be consumed from the provided API endpoints, no server-side script is needed.
- The wireframes are provided as advisory only, if you feel there are improvements to make, please make them.
- Bonus points for:
  - branding;
  - data service structure;
  - reusable components;
  - modern styling (grids, flex).
